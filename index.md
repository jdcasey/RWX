### Introduction

RWX is a library that handles the rendering and parsing of XML-RPC messages. It supports SAX-style handler classes, STaX-style event processors, and annotation-driven data binding. It also provides a SPI for implementing your own HTTP client that communicates over XML-RPC, with a default implementation that uses Apache HttpClient 4.x.
